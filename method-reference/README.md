Method Reference
----------------
Method Reference is a shorthand notation of lambda expression to call a method

Method References are 3 types

1. Reference to a static method

       Class::staticMethod
2. Reference to an instance method
    
       object::instanceMethod
3. Reference to a constructor

       Class::new

for constructor reference - we need to define functional interface with an abstract method
whose return type is same as the object with which we intend to make a constructor reference
